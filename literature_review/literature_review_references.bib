	shorttitle = {Lookahead {Optimizer}},
	abstract = {The vast majority of successful deep neural networks are trained using variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. Recent attempts to improve SGD can be broadly categorized into two approaches: (1) adaptive learning rate schemes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, and (2) accelerated schemes, such as heavy-ball and Nesterov momentum. In this paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm, Lookahead, that is orthogonal to these previous approaches and iteratively updates two sets of weights. Intuitively, the algorithm chooses a search direction by looking ahead at the sequence of “fast weights" generated by another optimizer. We show that Lookahead improves the learning stability and lowers the variance of its inner optimizer with negligible computation and memory cost. We empirically demonstrate Lookahead can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of SGD and Adam, even with their default hyperparameter settings on ImageNet, CIFAR10/100, neural machine translation, and Penn Treebank.},

Increases in capabilities and autonomy may soon massively amplify AI's impact, with risks that include large-scale social harms, malicious uses, and an irreversible loss of human control over autonomous AI systems. Although researchers have warned of extreme risks from AI, there is a lack of consensus about how exactly such risks arise, and how to manage them. Society's response, despite promising first steps, is incommensurate with the possibility of rapid, transformative progress that is expected by many experts. AI safety research is lagging.

Maintenance of publications is done manually by the researcher herself, and involves deleting erroneous ones, merging ones that are the same but which were not recognized as the same, adding forgotten co-authors, and correcting titles of papers and venues. The publications are presented on pages with 20 or 100 papers in the web page interface from 2012–2014. (Since mid 2014, Google Scholar's profile pages allow any number of papers on a single page.) The interface does not allow a scientist to merge two versions of a paper if they appear on different pages. This not only implies that a scientist who wants to merge certain subsets of publications will sometimes be unable to do so, but also, we show in this note that the decision problem to determine if it is possible to merge given subsets of papers is NP-complete.},
